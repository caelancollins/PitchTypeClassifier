Classify Pitch Types Using PITCHf/x Data

Attached to this email is some PITCHf/x data from a few years ago. An important aspect of
PITCHf/x data is attaching pitch tags to the data – that is, is a given pitch a fastball, curveball, etc?
We’d like you to take a stab at creating your own pitch classification algorithm. In the process of
creating your own algorithm, you should also get a sense of what the most important variables are
here – i.e., does vertical movement matter more than horizontal movement?
